- [x] Feature

### Priority
- [x] Must Have (P0)

### Scope Description

**User Experience:**
- User enters email address with real-time format validation
- User creates password with strength indicator (weak/medium/strong)
- Password visibility toggle available
- User provides basic profile: First name, Last name, Date of Birth, Gender
- Date of Birth captured via date picker with automatic age calculation
- Gender options: Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say
- Age gate validates user is 18+ (blocks underage with clear message)
- Inline validation provides immediate feedback on all fields

**Data Captured:**
| Field | Format | Validation | Privacy |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| Email | standard@example.com | Valid format, unique, not disposable | Login only |
| Password | 8+ chars | Min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special | Hashed (bcrypt) |
| First Name | Text | 2-50 characters | Display |
| Last Name | Text | 2-50 characters | Display |
| Date of Birth | YYYY-MM-DD | 18+ years required | Analytics only |
| Gender | Enum | Required selection | AI context only |

**UI Screens (Mobile Primary):**
- Screen 1: Email + Password entry
- Screen 2: Basic Profile (Name, DOB, Gender)
- Navigation: Progress indicator, back navigation supported

**Behaviors:**
- Form state persisted if user navigates away briefly
- "Show password" toggle for accessibility
- Disposable email addresses blocked with friendly message
- Duplicate email detection redirects to sign-in or password reset
- Network errors trigger auto-retry (3x) with local save

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a new user on the registration screen,
When they enter a valid email, strong password, and complete profile,
Then an account is created and user proceeds to consent flow.

Given a user enters an email already registered,
When they attempt to submit,
Then they see "This email is already registered. Sign in or reset password?"

Given a user enters a date of birth showing age < 18,
When they submit,
Then registration is blocked with "yHealth is for users 18+. Contact support@yhealth.com for assistance."

Given a user enters a weak password,
When they type,
Then the strength indicator shows "Weak" and suggests improvements in real-time.

Given a user enters a disposable email domain,
When they submit,
Then they see "Please use a permanent email address (no temporary emails)."

### Success Metrics
- Completion Rate: 95%+ (started → account created)
- Time to Complete: <2 minutes
- Validation Error Rate: <5%
- Auto-retry Success: 95%+ on network errors

### Constraints & Requirements

### Story Type
- [x] Feature

### Priority
- [x] Must Have (P0)

### Scope Description

**User Experience:**
- Social sign-in buttons prominently displayed on registration screen
- Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In available
- One-tap authentication flow via OAuth 2.0
- Profile information auto-filled from social provider (name, email)
- User completes only missing required fields (DOB, Gender if not provided)
- Seamless redirect back to yHealth after authorization

**OAuth 2.0 Flow:**
1. User taps "Continue with Apple" or "Continue with Google"
2. Native OAuth dialog appears (ASWebAuthenticationSession iOS / Custom Tabs Android)
3. User authorizes yHealth to access basic profile
4. OAuth returns access token + profile data
5. yHealth creates account with provided data
6. User completes any missing required fields
7. Proceeds to consent flow (S01.1.3)

**Data Auto-Filled:**
| Provider | Data Provided | Required After |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Apple | Email, Name (if shared) | DOB, Gender |
| Google | Email, Name, Profile Photo | DOB, Gender |

**Behaviors:**
- If email already exists from prior social login, sign user in
- If email exists from email registration, prompt to link accounts
- "Hide My Email" (Apple) supported with relay handling
- Failed OAuth redirects user back with clear error message
- Token stored securely (Keychain iOS / Keystore Android)

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a new user on the registration screen,
When they tap "Continue with Apple" and authorize,
Then an account is created with Apple profile data and user proceeds to complete DOB/Gender.

Given a new user on the registration screen,
When they tap "Continue with Google" and authorize,
Then an account is created with Google profile data and user proceeds to complete DOB/Gender.

Given a user whose social email already exists in yHealth,
When they complete OAuth,
Then they are signed in to existing account (not duplicate created).

Given a user denies OAuth authorization,
When redirect occurs,
Then user returns to registration screen with "Authorization cancelled. Try again or use email."

Given OAuth redirect fails or times out,
When error detected,
Then user sees "Connection failed. Check your internet and try again." with retry button.

AI: "Welcome! I'm here to help you become the best version of yourself.
     What's the main thing you want to improve about your health right now?"

User: "I want to lose weight. I've tried a lot but nothing sticks."

AI: "I hear you - that's frustrating. What have you tried before,
     and what made it hard to stick with?"

User: "Keto, intermittent fasting... work stress makes me snack a lot."

AI: "Stress-eating is so common. When you're stressed, what do you
     typically reach for? Sweet, salty, or just whatever's nearby?"

[Conversation continues naturally...]
```

**AI Personality & Tone:**
- Warm, empathetic, non-judgmental coach
- Curious and reflective (not interrogative)
- Celebrates honesty: "Thanks for sharing that - it helps me personalize better"
- Validates struggles: "That's a common challenge - you're not alone"
- Appropriate use of emoji (minimal, supportive)

**Adaptive Depth Control:**
- If user gives short answers → Offer to switch to Quick mode
- If user gives detailed stories → Continue open-ended exploration
- Progress indicator updates dynamically based on conversation length

**Data Captured:**
- Full conversation transcript (for future reference)
- Extracted insights:
  - Past attempts and why they failed
  - Emotional relationship with food/exercise
  - Daily routine and constraints
  - Support system and environment
  - Intrinsic motivations (deeper "why")

### Acceptance Criteria
Given a user selecting Deep Assessment,
When they engage in conversation with AI,
Then the conversation feels natural and personalized to their responses.

Given a user provides short, minimal responses,
When AI detects pattern (3+ short answers),
Then AI offers: "Want to try quick questions instead? Faster and easier."

Given a user shares emotional/sensitive information,
When AI responds,
Then the response is empathetic and non-judgmental.

Given a user types an unrealistic goal,
When AI detects it,
Then AI gently reality-checks: "That's ambitious! What's driving this timeline?"

Given a user wants to switch to Quick Assessment,
When they request it,
Then transition occurs with conversation data preserved.

Given Deep Assessment completes,
When user finishes,
Then conversation transcript and extracted insights are saved.

2. Permission explanation screen:
   "We'll sync your WHOOP data including:
    ✓ Daily Strain scores
    ✓ Recovery scores
    ✓ Sleep performance
    ✓ Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

    We won't access: Your WHOOP journal entries (private)

    [Authorize WHOOP] [Cancel]"
   ↓
3. Redirect to WHOOP OAuth page (native dialog)
   ↓
4. User logs into WHOOP, grants permissions
   ↓
5. Redirect back to yHealth with access token
   ↓
6. Confirmation: "✓ WHOOP Connected! Syncing your last 30 days..."
```

- Auto-refresh before expiration
- Re-authorization prompt if refresh fails

### Acceptance Criteria
Given user taps "Connect" on an integration,
When permission screen displays,
Then clear explanation of synced data is shown.

Given user taps "Authorize",
When OAuth flow completes successfully,
Then user returns to yHealth with confirmation message.

Given user denies OAuth authorization,
When redirect occurs,
Then user sees "Authorization cancelled. Try again or use another integration."

Given OAuth redirect fails,
When error detected,
Then user sees troubleshooting options and retry button.

Given token is stored,
When user closes and reopens app,
Then integration remains connected without re-authorization.

Given token expires,
When refresh is needed,
Then auto-refresh occurs silently (or re-auth prompt if fails).

### Success Metrics
- OAuth Success Rate: 95%+
- Authorization Denial Rate: <10%
- Token Refresh Success: 99%+
- Time to Connect: <60 seconds per integration

### Constraints & Requirements

## S01.4.3: Data Sync & Conflict Resolution

### User Story
**As a** new yHealth user who connected integrations,
**I want to** have my historical data synced and see clear status of ongoing syncs,
**So that** yHealth has my health history and I know my data is up-to-date.

### Story Type
- [x] Feature

### Priority
- [x] Must Have (P0)

### Scope Description

**User Experience:**
- Initial sync: Pull last 30 days of historical data
- Progress indicator during sync: "Syncing... 12 of 30 days imported"
- Ongoing sync: Real-time or near-real-time per integration
- Sync status dashboard showing last sync time per integration
- Multi-source conflict resolution (when same data from multiple sources)

**Sync Frequencies:**
| Integration | Initial Sync | Ongoing Sync | Method |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| WHOOP | 30 days | Every 15 min | Webhook + polling |
| Apple Health | 30 days | Real-time | HealthKit background |
| Fitbit | 30 days | Every 15 min | Subscription API |
| MyFitnessPal | 30 days | Every 1 hour | Polling |
| Strava | 30 days | Real-time | Webhook |
| Oura | 30 days | Every 6 hours | Polling (daily data) |

**Sync Status Indicators:**
```
Integration Status:

Apple Watch: ✅ Synced 5 min ago
WHOOP: ✅ Synced 12 min ago
MyFitnessPal: ⚠️ Last sync 25 hours ago [Re-authorize]
Strava: ❌ Connection lost [Reconnect]
```

**Conflict Resolution (Golden Source Hierarchy):**
When same metric comes from multiple sources:
1. **Heart Rate:** WHOOP > Apple > Fitbit > Garmin
2. **Sleep:** Oura > WHOOP > Apple > Fitbit
3. **Steps:** Apple > Fitbit > Garmin > Samsung
4. **Workouts:** Primary device set by user, fallback to most detailed

User can override hierarchy in settings.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given integration is connected,
When initial sync begins,
Then 30 days of historical data is pulled with progress indicator.

Given initial sync is running,
When user views progress,
Then they see "Syncing... X of 30 days imported".

Given ongoing sync is active,
When new data is available at source,
Then yHealth syncs within the defined frequency.

Given sync status dashboard is viewed,
When integrations have varying states,
Then clear status indicators show each integration's health.

Given data conflict exists (same metric, multiple sources),
When data is processed,
Then golden source hierarchy is applied silently.

Given sync fails 3+ times,
When failure persists,
Then user is notified and support escalation is offered.

### Success Metrics
- Initial Sync Completion: 95%+ within 5 minutes
- Sync Reliability: 99%+ uptime
- Time to First Data: <2 min from authorization
- Conflict Resolution Accuracy: 100% (rules applied correctly)

### Constraints & Requirements
| Performance | Security | Privacy | Accessibility | Compatibility |

### Edge Cases & Errors
| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| API rate limit hit | Exponential backoff, retry later |
| No historical data available | Start collecting from now |
| Integration API down | Show status, auto-retry when up |
| Duplicate data from same source | Deduplicate by timestamp |
| User disconnects integration | Stop sync, optionally delete data |

### Open Questions
- Data retention default (2 years?)
- User ability to delete specific integration data

### Definition of Done
- [ ] 30-day historical sync for all integrations

### Scope Description

**User Experience:**
- Plan generates in <30 seconds
- Progress indicator shows generation steps
- Plan synthesizes: Assessment, Goals, Integrations, Preferences
- 12-week plan structure with weekly breakdown
- TDEE/macro calculations included for nutrition
- Fitness, Nutrition, and Wellbeing pillars covered

**Plan Generation Inputs:**
| Source | Data Used |
|--------|-----------|
| F1.2 Assessment | Goal, baseline metrics, past attempts, challenges |
| F1.3 Goals | SMART goals, milestones, motivation |
| F1.4 Integrations | Wearable data, baseline HR/sleep/activity |
| F1.5 Preferences | Engagement mode, coaching style, channels |

**Plan Components:**

**Fitness Plan:**
- Exercise frequency based on baseline + goal
- Exercise types tailored to goal (cardio for weight loss, strength for muscle)
- Progressive overload: Volume increases every 4 weeks
- Rest days mandatory based on recovery data
- Heart rate zones from wearable data

**Nutrition Plan:**
- TDEE calculation (Mifflin-St Jeor formula)
- Calorie target: TDEE ± deficit/surplus for goal
- Macro split personalized to goal (e.g., high protein for muscle)
- Respects dietary restrictions
- Tracking frequency recommendation

**Wellbeing Plan:**
- Sleep target based on assessment
- Stress management activities (journaling, meditation)
- Mood tracking frequency
- Energy optimization strategies

**TDEE Calculation:**
```
BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + modifier
  modifier: +5 (men), -161 (women)

TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier
  Sedentary: 1.2 | Light: 1.375 | Moderate: 1.55 | Active: 1.725
```
