# [M-003] MVP Epic Stories Complete (E01-E07)

## Summary
Generated 120 user stories across all 7 MVP epics (E01-E07). Each epic includes technical foundation stories, feature stories, and follows established patterns for consistency.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Stories define WHAT not HOW | Implementation deferred to tasks |
| Flexible story sizing | Natural scope determines size |
| Technical foundation stories (S0X.0.1) | External API/platform setup patterns |
| Bootstrap AI approach | Research-based prompts first, AI personalizes over time |
| Dual Recovery Score | Physical + Mental separate (not combined) |

## Artifacts Created

- [E01 Stories (15)](../stories/Epic-01-Stories.md) - Onboarding & Assessment
- [E02 Stories (16)](../stories/Epic-02-Stories.md) - Voice Coaching

- [E07 Stories (18)](../stories/Epic-07-Stories.md) - Wellbeing Pillar

## Story Patterns Established

| Pattern | Example | Guidance |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Technical foundation | S03.0.1 (WhatsApp API Config) | Create S0X.0.1 for external API setup |
| Media split 2-way | Photo: pipeline + confirmation | Split input from output/confirmation |
| Proactive split 3-way | Nudges: engine, timing, policy | Engine + timing + policy compliance |
| Dashboard split 3-way | Core layout + content + adaptation | Structure + dynamic + personalization |

## Context
