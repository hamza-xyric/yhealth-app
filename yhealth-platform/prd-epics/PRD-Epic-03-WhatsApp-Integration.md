## F3.7: CROSS-CHANNEL SYNC

### Description
Seamless synchronization of WhatsApp conversations, logged data, and insights across all yHealth channels (Mobile App, Voice Coaching) - ensuring users can start a conversation on WhatsApp, continue on a voice call, and review history in the app without losing context or repeating information.

### User Story
As an **Optimization Enthusiast** (P3), I want my conversations and data to sync across WhatsApp, the app, and voice calls so that I can switch between channels based on my situation without losing context or having to repeat myself.

### Flexibility Modes

| Mode | Experience |
|------|------------|
| **Light** | Basic data sync - logged entries appear everywhere, but conversation history summary only. Access last 24h of WhatsApp chat in app. |
| **Deep** | Full sync - complete conversation history accessible in app, voice call summaries delivered to WhatsApp, cross-channel context maintained indefinitely. |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Sync latency | <5 minutes for data to appear across all channels | Sync monitoring |
| Conversation context retention | 95% of cross-channel interactions maintain context | Manual review sampling |
| User satisfaction with continuity | 4.5/5 rating on seamless experience | User surveys |
| Cross-channel usage | 60% of users actively use 2+ channels | Multi-channel analytics |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WhatsApp messages sync to Mobile App inbox within 5 minutes
- [ ] Data logged via WhatsApp appears in app dashboard immediately (steps, meals, mood, etc.)
- [ ] Voice call summaries sent to WhatsApp after call ends
- [ ] App-based actions reflected in WhatsApp: "Goal achieved!" notification sent to WhatsApp
- [ ] Conversation context maintained across channels:
  - WhatsApp: "What workout should I do?"
  - Voice Call (2 hours later): "Let's review that workout plan we discussed"
  - AI remembers the WhatsApp conversation
- [ ] Light mode syncs data and 24-hour conversation history
- [ ] Deep mode syncs full conversation history (30+ days)
- [ ] User can access WhatsApp conversation history in app's "Messages" section
- [ ] Notifications cross-channel: Insight generated → Delivered to WhatsApp AND app notification
- [ ] Preference changes sync instantly: Quiet hours set in app → WhatsApp respects immediately
- [ ] Offline mode support: WhatsApp messages queue when offline, sync when reconnected

### Error Handling Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery Behavior | User Communication |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Sync delay (>10min)** | Delayed message delivery | Retry sync, alert if >30min | "Your data is syncing. It may take a few minutes to appear everywhere." |
| **Sync conflict** | Same data edited on multiple channels | Use latest timestamp, prompt if ambiguous | "Updated your mood to 7/10 (from app). WhatsApp shows 6/10 earlier - keeping latest." |
| **Conversation history gap** | Missing messages in sync | Backfill from server | Silent: fetch missing messages from database |
| **Channel unavailable** | App offline, WhatsApp API down | Queue updates, sync when available | Silent: queue and retry |
| **Context loss detected** | AI can't retrieve prior context | Acknowledge and ask for repeat | "Sorry, I seem to have lost our earlier conversation. Could you remind me what we discussed?" |

### Sync Architecture

```
User Action (Any Channel)
    ↓
Central Event Bus (Azure Service Bus)
    ↓
Event Logged to Database (PostgreSQL)
    ↓
Publish to All Active Channels:
    - WhatsApp Message Sent
    - Mobile App Push Notification
    - Voice Session Context Updated
    - Web Dashboard (Future)
    ↓
Sync Confirmation (per channel)
    ↓
User Sees Data Everywhere

Sync Intervals:
- Real-time: Critical events (insights, alerts, messages)
- Near real-time (<5min): Data logs (meals, mood, workouts)
- Periodic (15min): Conversation history backfill
- On-demand: User-initiated "Refresh"
```

### Cross-Channel Interaction Patterns

**Pattern 1: WhatsApp → Voice → App**
1. User on WhatsApp: "I'm feeling stressed about work"
2. AI suggests: "Want to talk about it? I can call you now."
3. User starts voice call → AI references WhatsApp conversation: "You mentioned work stress..."
4. After call, summary sent to WhatsApp + saved in app "Session History"

**Pattern 2: App → WhatsApp → App**
1. User sets goal in app: "Run 3x per week"
2. WhatsApp nudge: "Goal reminder: Run today?"
3. User completes run, logs in app
4. WhatsApp celebration: "Run logged! 1/3 this week! 🎉"

**Pattern 3: Voice → WhatsApp Follow-Up**
1. Voice coaching session discusses meal planning
2. After call, WhatsApp message: "Here's your meal plan from our call: [link]"
3. User clicks link → App opens to meal plan

**Pattern 4: Multi-Channel Insight Delivery**
1. Cross-domain insight detected: "Your energy is 30% higher on workout days"
2. Insight delivered simultaneously:
   - WhatsApp message with key takeaway
   - App notification with "View Details" link
   - Available in voice conversation context
3. User can engage on any channel
