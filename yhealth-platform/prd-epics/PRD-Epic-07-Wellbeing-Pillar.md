# yHealth Platform - Epic 07: Wellbeing Pillar

## EPIC OVERVIEW

### Epic Statement
The Wellbeing Pillar is ONE of yHealth's THREE EQUAL PILLARS (Physical Fitness, Nutrition, Daily Wellbeing) that enables users to track, understand, and improve their mental and emotional health through mood tracking, journaling, habit formation, stress detection, and mindfulness recommendations - all powered by AI insights and cross-domain intelligence.

### Epic Goal
Treat Daily Wellbeing as an EQUAL pillar alongside Fitness and Nutrition, delivering real-time mental health insights and patterns that competitors miss by relegating mental health to monthly surveys. This is yHealth's KEY DIFFERENTIATOR in the market.

### Core Philosophy
**"Daily Wellbeing as Equal Pillar" Strategy:** While competitors like WHOOP and BEVEL treat mental health as an afterthought (monthly surveys), yHealth makes Daily Wellbeing a first-class pillar with real-time tracking, multi-signal stress detection, and cross-pillar correlations that reveal how your mind affects your body and vice versa.

## F7.5: STRESS PATTERN DETECTION

### Description
Multi-signal stress detection system that combines self-reported stress ratings with biometric cues (heart rate variability, resting heart rate), text sentiment analysis from journaling, and app usage patterns to identify stress levels and patterns. This comprehensive approach reveals stress even when users don't explicitly report it.

### User Story
As a **Holistic Health Seeker** (P1), I want the AI to detect stress patterns from multiple signals - not just when I remember to log it - so that I can get proactive recommendations before stress accumulates and affects my health, mood, and performance.

### Flexibility Modes

| Mode | Experience |
|------|------------|
| **Light** | Simple stress rating 1-10 once daily. AI detects stress from other signals (HRV, mood, journaling tone) and alerts when patterns concerning. |
| **Deep** | Detailed stress tracking: self-ratings multiple times/day, biometric stress monitoring, stress triggers identification, coping strategy effectiveness tracking, stress pattern reports. |

### User Decisions Applied
- **MULTI-SIGNAL approach:** Use ALL available data (self-report + biometrics + text sentiment + app usage patterns)
- **Even if user doesn't use app, that's an insight:** Non-usage may indicate busy/stressed/unmotivated/annoyed - validate later
- **Proactive stress detection:** AI surfaces stress patterns before user consciously recognizes them
- **No crisis intervention system:** Just don't promote self-harm (per PRD Section 14 boundaries)

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Stress detection accuracy | 70% user agreement when AI flags stress | Validation surveys |
| Multi-signal stress insights | 60% receive stress insights from non-self-report signals | Insight source analytics |

  - Daily stress check-in prompt (evening)
  - On-demand stress logging anytime
  - Stress triggers tagging: Work, Relationships, Finances, Health, Family, Uncertainty, Other

- [ ] **Signal 2: Biometric Cues (if available from wearables)**
  - Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Low HRV = higher stress
  - Resting Heart Rate: Elevated RHR = potential stress indicator
  - Sleep disruption patterns: Poor sleep correlates with stress
  - Compare biometrics to user's 30-day baseline

- [ ] **Signal 3: Text Sentiment Analysis**
  - Analyze journaling entries for stress-related language
  - Detect keywords: "overwhelmed," "anxious," "stressed," "can't cope," "too much"
  - Sentiment scoring: Negative sentiment trends indicate stress accumulation
  - Tone shift detection: Sudden change from positive to negative journaling

- [ ] **Signal 4: App Usage Patterns**
  - Reduced engagement = possible stress/overwhelm ("too busy to use app")
  - Irregular logging patterns = life disruption indicator
  - Missed routines (journaling, habits, mood check-ins) = stress signal

### Multi-Signal Stress Detection Algorithm

```
Stress Level Calculation (0-10 Scale):

Base Score (if self-reported):
- User's self-reported stress rating (1-10)

Biometric Adjustments (if wearable data available):
- Low HRV (below 30-day baseline): +1 to +3 points
- Elevated RHR (above baseline): +1 to +2 points
- Poor sleep quality (<60/100): +1 point
- Sleep disruption (wake-ups >5): +1 point

Text Sentiment Adjustments:
- Negative journaling sentiment: +1 to +2 points
- Stress keywords detected: +1 point per occurrence (max +3)
- Tone shift (positive → negative): +1 point

Behavioral Adjustments:
- Missed check-ins for 3+ days: +1 point (may indicate overwhelm)
- Irregular logging patterns: +0.5 points
- Decreased engagement: +0.5 points
- Increased mood logging (possible awareness): +0.5 points

Final Stress Score = Base + Adjustments (capped at 10)

Stress Categories:
- 0-3: Low stress (green)
- 4-6: Moderate stress (yellow)
- 7-8: High stress (orange)
- 9-10: Extreme stress (red)

Alert Triggers:
- Score ≥7 for 3+ consecutive days
- Score increase >3 points in 24 hours
- Biometric stress + low self-report (user may not recognize stress)
- Journaling sentiment decline without stress self-report
```

### Stress Pattern Insights

**Time-of-Day Patterns:**
- "Your stress peaks between 2-5pm on workdays. Plan breaks during this window."
- "Morning stress is 60% higher on Mondays. Sunday evening routine could help."

**Trigger Patterns:**
- "Work stress accounts for 70% of high-stress days. Set boundaries?"
- "Relationship stress correlates with sleep disruption. Communication patterns to explore?"

**Coping Effectiveness:**
- "Exercise reduces stress by 35% within 2 hours. Use movement as stress intervention."
- "Journaling before bed lowers next-day stress by 20%."

**Cross-Pillar Connections:**
- "Stress 50% lower on days with 7+ hours sleep and morning workout."
- "High-stress weeks = 40% worse recovery scores. Prioritize rest."

### Error Handling Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery Behavior | User Communication |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Chronic extreme stress** | Stress ≥9 for 5+ days | Escalation protocol (PRD Section 14) | "Your stress is very high. Consider talking to a professional?" + resources |
| **Stress detected but not self-reported** | Biometrics + sentiment indicate stress, no self-report | Gentle inquiry | "I'm noticing some stress signals. How are you really feeling?" |
| **User busy, not logging** | No app usage for 5+ days | Non-intrusive check-in | "Haven't heard from you. Busy week? Even 'I'm swamped' helps me understand." |
| **Conflicting signals** | Low self-report stress but high biometric stress | Surface discrepancy | "You said stress is low, but your body signals show tension. Explore this?" |

### Cross-Pillar Connections

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Users don't value daily wellbeing tracking** | Critical | Medium | Education on cross-pillar insights, demonstrate value early via mood-workout correlations, light mode for minimal effort |
| **Journaling feels like homework** | High | Medium | Hybrid prompts reduce blank-page anxiety, light mode = 2-min entries valid, celebrate all reflection |
| **Mental Recovery Score questioned** | High | Medium | Transparent methodology, user feedback loops, gradual education on mental recovery importance |
| **Multi-signal stress detection privacy concerns** | High | Low | Clear communication on how signals used, user control over data sources, opt-out options |
| **Crisis detection false positives/negatives** | Critical | Medium | Conservative thresholds, human review for escalations, user can dismiss alerts, resources always provided |
| **Mindfulness recommendations ignored** | Medium | Medium | Context-aware timing, accept/decline tracking, reduce frequency if rejected, quality over quantity |
| **Habit tracking too complex** | Medium | Low | Pre-populated suggestions, templates, light mode = simple checkboxes, gradual progression to deep mode |
| **Cross-pillar correlations insufficient data** | High | Medium | Encourage multi-pillar logging, patience messaging ("insights improve with data"), baseline insights from Day 1 |
