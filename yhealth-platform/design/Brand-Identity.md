## Brand Values

### 1. Integration Over Specialization
Value comes from connecting everything, not from being the best at any single thing. We prioritize breadth of integration over depth in individual domains.

### 2. Insights Over Data
Users don't want more data; they want unimaginable insights. Every feature must deliver insights that users couldn't discover themselves.

### 3. Invisible Intelligence
The best AI coaching feels effortless and intuitive. Complex AI operations translate into simple, actionable guidance.

### 4. User Transformation Focus
Success is measured by user life improvements, not vanity metrics. Every product decision prioritizes actual user outcomes.

### 5. Honest Guidance
We tell it like it is, with care. No false positivity or empty encouragement. Real progress comes from honest feedback.

## Character Design System

yHealth uses illustrated characters to create emotional connection and make the app feel alive. Characters are central to the playful, expressive visual identity.

### The Coach Character: "Sage"

The AI coach is personified as **Sage** - an illustrated character that appears throughout the app, reacting to user input and delivering guidance with personality.

#### Character Concept
- **Visual Style**: Friendly, abstract humanoid illustration (not realistic human, not too cartoonish)
- **Form**: Rounded, approachable shape - think Headspace's characters meets Duolingo's warmth
- **Colors**: Warm teal gradient (primary brand color) with expressive accents
- **Size**: Appears in various sizes from avatar (32px) to featured moments (120px+)

#### Expression States

Sage has defined expression states that match the conversation context:

| Expression | When Used | Visual Cues |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Happy** | Positive updates, achievements, greetings | Upturned eyes, warm glow |
| **Celebratory** | Goal completion, streaks, milestones | Eyes closed in joy, raised arms, confetti around |
| **Curious** | Asking questions, prompting reflection | Tilted head, raised eyebrow, ? thought bubble |
| **Supportive** | User struggling, missed goals, low mood | Soft eyes, gentle stance, warm colors |
| **Concerned** | Health alerts, significant changes | Alert posture, gentle warning tone |
| **Thinking** | Processing, generating insights | Eyes looking up, dots animation, subtle bounce |
| **Listening** | During voice input | Calm stance, sound wave animation nearby |

#### Sage Personality in Design
- **Never robotic**: Sage should feel alive, not like a generic chatbot avatar
- **Reactive**: Sage's expression should match message tone
- **Celebratory**: Sage loves celebrating wins with the user
- **Supportive**: Sage never judges, always encourages

#### Avatar Usage

| Context | Size | Expression |
|---------|------|------------|
| Chat bubble header | 32px | Matches message tone |
| AI Question card | 48px | Curious (usually) |
| Achievement unlock | 120px | Celebratory with animation |
| Empty state | 80px | Inviting/curious |
| Error state | 64px | Concerned but supportive |

---

### Pillar Creatures

Each of the three pillars has an animated "creature" that represents progress in that domain. These creatures grow, shrink, and react based on the user's engagement and scores.

#### Fitness Creature: "Ember" (Flame)

- **Concept**: A friendly flame character representing energy, warmth, and physical vitality
- **Visual Style**: Warm gradient (orange → coral → soft yellow), rounded flame shape with friendly face

|-------------|----------------|--------|

| 60-79 | **Steady** | Medium, warm glow, gentle flicker |
| 40-59 | **Dimming** | Smaller, softer colors, slower movement |

### Creature Interaction Patterns

#### Home Screen Display
- All three creatures displayed in a row
- Size proportional to relative score
- Tapping opens pillar detail view
- Creatures react to each other (high scores celebrate, low scores get support from others)

#### Score-Based Behavior
```
Score 0-39:   Creature at 60% size, muted colors, slow animation
Score 40-59:  Creature at 80% size, normal colors, moderate animation
Score 60-79:  Creature at 100% size, vibrant colors, active animation
Score 80-100: Creature at 110% size, enhanced colors, celebratory animation
```

#### Collective Celebration
When all three creatures are at 80+ scores, they trigger a special "trio celebration" animation - all three dance together briefly.

---

### Character Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: All characters share the same illustration style (line weight, shading approach, face proportions)
2. **Accessibility**: Expressions must be distinguishable at small sizes; never rely on color alone
3. **Animation Budget**: Characters should feel alive but not distracting - idle animations are subtle
4. **Emotional Resonance**: Characters should make users smile, not cringe
5. **Scalability**: Designs must work from 32px avatar to 200px featured display

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Voice (Consistent)
Our voice is **playful, warm, and honest**. It remains consistent across all touchpoints.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Playful** | Light-hearted, occasional humor, celebrates joyfully |
| **Warm** | Human, caring, genuinely supportive, like a friend |
| **Honest** | Direct when needed, no sugar-coating, but always kind |
| **Curious** | Asks questions, prompts reflection, shows genuine interest |

### Tone (Adaptive)
Tone shifts based on context and user emotional state:

#### Celebrating Success
**Tone**: Genuinely excited, playful, celebratory
```
"Yes! 5 days of hitting your protein goal. You're crushing it! 🎉"
"Best sleep score this month - you found your rhythm!"
"21 days straight. That's not a streak, that's a habit. I'm proud of you."
```

#### Supporting Through Difficulty
**Tone**: Gentle, understanding, no judgment
```
"Tough day, huh? One rest day never undid anyone's progress. Be kind to yourself."
"Energy's low today - I can see it in your data. That's okay. Listen to what your body's telling you."
"Stress is real. Let's focus on one small thing you can control right now."
```

#### Delivering Insights
**Tone**: Friendly curiosity, helpful, actionable
```
"Here's something interesting: your workouts are 40% better after 7+ hours of sleep. Wild, right?"
"I noticed something - you tend to skip meals on meeting-heavy days. Want to plan ahead next time?"
"Your mood and morning routine are definitely connected. Consistency really does matter for you."
```

#### Asking Questions (NEW)
**Tone**: Curious, inviting, never demanding
```
"I noticed you slept better last week. What was different? 🤔"
"How are you feeling right now? Just checking in."
"Tough meeting earlier? Want to talk about it?"
```

#### Providing Nudges
**Tone**: Friendly suggestion, easy to dismiss
```
"15-minute walk? Your energy usually dips around now. No pressure though!"
"You usually feel better after journaling. Want to get some thoughts out?"
"Quick check-in? It'll take 30 seconds. Or skip if you're not feeling it."
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's
- **Be concise**: Say more with less
- **Be specific**: Use data and specifics, not vague encouragement
- **Be human**: Write like you're texting a supportive friend
- **Use "you"**: Direct address creates connection
- **Celebrate joyfully**: Make wins feel genuinely exciting
- **Ask questions**: Prompt reflection, don't just inform
- **Use emojis sparingly**: One per message max, when celebrating or softening
- **Give easy outs**: "No pressure", "or skip if you're not feeling it"

### Don'ts
- **Don't use jargon**: Avoid medical or technical terms
- **Don't be preachy**: No lecturing or guilt-tripping
- **Don't over-explain**: Trust users to understand
- **Don't be fake-positive**: Authentic > cheerful
- **Don't use corporate speak**: "Leverage," "synergy," "optimize"
- **Don't overuse emojis**: Not every message needs one
- **Don't demand action**: Suggest, don't command

### Word Choice

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Optimize your wellness journey" | "Feel better every day" |
| "Leverage your data insights" | "Here's what your data shows" |
| "Achieve optimal performance" | "Perform at your best" |
| "Your metrics indicate" | "Your data shows" |
| "Suboptimal sleep detected" | "Your sleep was off last night" |

## Brand Story

### The Problem
Health data is fragmented. Fitness trackers don't talk to nutrition apps. Mood tracking lives separately from sleep data. Users generate massive amounts of health information across dozens of apps and devices - but this data lives in silos, preventing the discovery of life-changing insights.

### The Insight
The most powerful health insights come from **connections** - how sleep affects workouts, how nutrition impacts mood, how stress influences everything. But no single app connects these dots. Users are left to figure it out themselves.

### The Solution
yHealth is the first AI Life Coach that treats Fitness, Nutrition, and Daily Wellbeing as **three equal pillars**. By connecting your complete health ecosystem, we deliver "unimaginable insights" - correlations and predictions that no specialist app can provide.

### The Difference
Unlike passive dashboards, yHealth is a conversational coach. Available 24/7 through Voice calls, WhatsApp chat, or Mobile app. Adapting to your emotional state. Delivering guidance exactly when you need it. Becoming the second mind you didn't know you needed.
