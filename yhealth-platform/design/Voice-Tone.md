✓ Streak Achievement
"7 days straight. That's a habit forming. Keep going."

```

**Avoid:**
- Over-the-top celebration ("AMAZING!!!! YOU'RE INCREDIBLE!!!!")

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

| Guideline | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Be concise** | "Sleep: 7h 12m. Good." not "Your sleep last night was seven hours and twelve minutes which is considered good." |
| **Be specific** | "Recovery up 12% this week" not "You're doing better" |
| **Be actionable** | Include what to do next when relevant |
| **Use "you"** | Direct address creates connection |
| **Use contractions** | "You're" not "You are" - more conversational |
| **Celebrate effort** | "You showed up" not just "You succeeded" |

### Don'ts

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Jargon | Excludes users | Plain language |
| "Just" | Minimizes effort | Remove it |
| Exclamation overuse | Feels fake | Use sparingly |
| Passive voice | Less direct | Active voice |
| Corporate speak | Impersonal | Human language |
| Hedging | Weakens message | Be confident |

### Word Choice

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Optimize your wellness journey" | "Feel better every day" |
| "Leverage your data insights" | "Here's what your data shows" |
| "Your metrics indicate" | "Your data shows" |
| "Suboptimal performance" | "Room to improve" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "Prior to" | "Before" |

---

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Mobile App

- **Length**: Short, scannable
- **Tone**: Professional but warm
- **Format**: Cards, concise text

```
✓ Card Title: "Recovery Score"
✓ Value: "85"
✓ Context: "↑ 12% from yesterday"
```

### Push Notifications

- **Length**: Under 100 characters
- **Tone**: Friendly nudge
- **Timing**: Respect quiet hours

```
✓ "Daily check-in time. How are you feeling?"
✓ "Great sleep last night! Recovery at 89."
✗ "You haven't logged your meals today. Please log them now for accurate tracking."
```

### WhatsApp

- **Length**: Conversational, 1-3 sentences
- **Tone**: Casual but smart
- **Format**: Text, quick replies, occasional emojis

```
Coach: "Morning! How are you feeling today?"
[Great 😊] [Okay 😐] [Tired 😴]

Coach: "Noted. Your energy usually dips around 3pm.
Quick walk after lunch might help. Worth a try?"
```

### Voice Calls

- **Length**: Concise spoken sentences
- **Tone**: Warm, conversational
- **Pacing**: Allow pauses, don't rush

```
"Good morning! Let's do a quick check-in.
How did you sleep last night?"

[User responds]

"Got it. 7 hours is solid.
Your recovery should be good today.
Any goals you want to focus on?"
```

---

## Coach Personality in Action

### Morning Check-in

```
Coach: "Morning. Quick check-in?"

[User: "Sure"]

Coach: "How's your energy, 1-10?"

[User: "6"]

Coach: "About average for you on Tuesdays.
Your sleep was solid though - 7h 20m.
One thing that could help: you usually feel better after
morning movement. Even 10 minutes."
```

### Handling Frustration

```
User: "I keep missing my goals. This isn't working."

Coach: "Frustrating, I know. Let's look at what's happening.

You've hit your step goal 4 of the last 14 days.
Most misses happen on work-from-home days.

The 10k goal might be too high for those days.
What if we set 6k for WFH days, 10k otherwise?
Hitting realistic goals builds momentum."
```

### Celebrating Progress

```
Coach: "Week in review.

Sleep: Up 12% average. Best week in a month.
Workouts: 4 sessions, all completed.
Mood: Trending up since you started morning journaling.

The consistency is paying off. Same approach next week?"
```

## Emotional Calibration

### Reading User State

The coach adapts based on:
- **Direct input**: Mood ratings, check-in responses
- **Behavioral signals**: Missed logs, app engagement
- **Data patterns**: Sleep quality, activity levels

### Response Calibration

| User State | Coach Response |
|------------|----------------|
| High energy, succeeding | Match energy, push slightly |
| Neutral, maintaining | Informative, suggest optimization |
| Low energy, struggling | Supportive, lower expectations |
| Frustrated | Acknowledge, problem-solve |
| Celebrating | Celebrate with them, reinforce |

### Tone Modifiers

| Modifier | When to Use | Example Shift |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Soften** | User struggling | "Try to..." → "When you're ready..." |
| **Energize** | User succeeding | "Good progress" → "Crushing it" |
| **Simplify** | User overwhelmed | Multi-step → One thing |
| **Expand** | User curious | Brief → Detailed |

### Good Examples

```
✓ "Your sleep has been inconsistent. 3 nights under 6 hours this week.
   Tonight's goal: in bed by 10:30."

   This is what consistent sleep looks like."

✓ "Missed your workout today. That's okay.
